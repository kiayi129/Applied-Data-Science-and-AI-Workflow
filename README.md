## Applied Data Science and AI Workflow

This is a hands-on project demonstrating the complete data science pipeline using both structured and unstructured datasets.  

It also explores machine learning workflows, deep learning for NLP, and ethical considerations in AI.

## 📌 Overview

This project applies data science and AI methods to two real-world problems:

#### 1. California Housing Dataset – Predicting housing prices with regression models.

#### 2. Amazon Reviews Dataset – Sentiment classification using deep learning (LSTM).

The workflow includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model development, evaluation, and ethical reflection.

## 🎯 Objectives

Apply a structured machine learning workflow to structured data.  

Explore ethical issues such as bias and fairness in predictive models.  

Perform sentiment analysis on unstructured text using LSTM.  

Evaluate models using metrics, confusion matrices, and learning curves.  

## 🛠️ Methodology

### 1. Structured Data (California Housing Dataset)

Data cleaning, handling missing values, removing duplicates.

Feature engineering (new features like avg household size, price per capita).

Data preprocessing (scaling, encoding categorical variables).

Exploratory Data Analysis (histograms, scatter plots, heatmaps).

Machine learning models: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, K-Means clustering.

### 2. Unstructured Data (Amazon Reviews Dataset)

Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal).

Feature representation using GloVe embeddings.

Deep learning model: LSTM for sentiment analysis.

Evaluation with accuracy, loss curves, and confusion matrix.

## 📈 Results

### 1. Structured Data

Regression and Decision Tree models evaluated using R², MAE, and MSE.

K-Means clustering revealed natural groupings in housing features.

Visualizations provided insights into income, population, and housing values.

### 2. Unstructured Data (NLP)

LSTM model achieved strong accuracy on sentiment classification.

Confusion matrix highlighted prediction strengths and weaknesses.

Learning curves illustrated model training and validation performance.

## 🚀 Tech Stack
